                    With years of experience in supply chain logistics and management,
                    I decided to take a huge leap and go for my dream career. As a recent
                    graduate in the Momentum program, I've had an amazing time learning JavaScript,
                    Python, Django and React. I've developed a passion for front end development which
                    led me to branch into React Native. Collaborating with others to create a mobile
                    app has been some of the most fulfilling work I've ever done. I'm aspiring to
                    bring a broad background with strong technical skills to excel as a Front-End Developer.
